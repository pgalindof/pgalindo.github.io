This task initiates with the infrastructure team submitting potential gains and expenses for each possible scenario for approval discussion. In this initial phase, it is necessary to verify the coherence of the provided data and identify any missing information.

Following this step, the data is incorporated into the financial modelling for a more in-depth valutaion. For each scenario its calculated the expected P&L up to the projected Cash Flow, taking into account items not provided by the infrastructure team but derived from a percentage of Net Revenue, such as Operational Payroll.

Then its computed the financial indicators that support managerial decision: NPV, IRR and the Payback.

Finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted with possible values of NPV by changing the variables that impact the project. The color scheme is utilized to signify different outcomes: Green represents sub-scenarios with higher NPV than the projected value; Yellow represents scenarios with positive but lower values than the projection, and Red represents negative sub-scenarios.

Upon completing the entire process, a presentation is crafted with this information and presented to the managers and executives.
