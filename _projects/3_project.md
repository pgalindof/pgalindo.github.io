The processes in this project happen simultaneously and are linked to each other. Until its conclusion, all steps are revisited and adjusted as the discussion evolves.

In this step, we insert the assumptions adopted for the calculations. Part of the information come from external departments, the other part are standard assumptions for this kind of project.

With the assumptions inputted in the model, we can compute each line in the P&L to get the financial indicators. This project considers the launch of 4 different courses for the certificate program.

After the calculation of the P&L, its developed different scenarios for presentation and discussion. Depending on what is aligned, either the project is concluded or its made the necessary adjustments.
