The processes in this project happen simultaneously and are interconnected. Until its conclusion, all steps are revisited and adjusted as the discussion evolves.

In this step, we insert the assumptions adopted for the calculations. Part of the information come from external departments, while the other part consists of standard assumptions for this kind of project.

With the assumptions inputted into model, we can compute each line in the P&L to derive the financial indicators. This project involves the launch of four different courses for the certificate program.

After calculating the P&L,  different scenarios are developed for presentation and discussion. Depending on the alignment, either the project is concluded or the necessary adjustments are made.
