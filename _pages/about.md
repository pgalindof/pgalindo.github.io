Senior Financial Analyst with experience in financial forecasting, budget management, sensitivity analysis and business unit valuation for large-sized businesses. I have worked at Cogna Educação and Grupo Dasa, which are strong competitors in the education and health sectors, respectively.

My analytical skills are complemented by advanced proficiency in various financial and data modeling tools. I possess expertise in programs such as Excel, Power BI, KNIME, and PowerPoint. Additionally, I am skilled in programming languages such as Python and SQL. Moreover, I have proficiency in other languages not directly related to finance, including LaTeX and HTML.
